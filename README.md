# Logic-LM Task 5: Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Demo

This repository contains my implementation for Task 5, where I adapted CIFAR-10 labels into a symbolic knowledge base and used a simple logic solver to answer reasoning questions.

- All code and results are in `logic_lm_task5_colab.ipynb`.
- Open the notebook in Google Colab for best results.
